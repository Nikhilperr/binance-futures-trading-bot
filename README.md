## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Multi-Symbol Scan Engine**: Iterates across active volatile trading pairs (e.g. `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `SOLUSDT`, `XRPUSDT`) to find trade setups quickly and boost performance data logs.
*   **2-Strategy Confluence Rule**: Never flies blind. The bot requires at least 2 distinct strategies to agree on direction, filtered by the 1h macro trend and derivatives crowding metrics.
*   **Self-Learning Weight Engine**: SQLite-backed temporal learning. Tracks win rates per indicator hourly (0-23 UTC) and adjusts weights dynamically every 20 trades.
*   **Real-time Glassmorphic UI Dashboard**: Switch between **Paper Trading** (Test mode) and **Live Trading** with a single click. Displays active metrics, open position details, holding timers, strategy win rates, and logs.
*   **Zero Fee Bleeding Gate (Fee Guardian)**: Automatically skips signals if expected ATR volatility moves are less than 3x the round-trip commission fee costs.
*   **Triple-Layer Drawdown Circuit Breakers**:
    *   **Daily Drawdown**: Pauses trading for 6 hours if account is down 10% today.
    *   **Weekly Drawdown**: Pauses trading for 24 hours if net loss over the last 7 days exceeds 20%.
    *   **Peak Drawdown**: Pauses trading for 48 hours if account is down 25% from all-time peak balance.
*   **Dynamic Compounding & Milestone Engine**: Reinvests profits automatically, scaling the goal to exactly **10x** the initial balance. Periodically triggers cash payouts (e.g. 10%-15% profit cashout) directly to Telegram.
*   **Maintenance & Event Aware**: Scrapes Binance support announcements via regex. Pauses trading 30 minutes before and during scheduled upgrades, and halves position sizing during high-volatility events.
*   **Telegram Integration**: Sends instant trade entries/exits, daily summary statistics, heartbeats, and circuit breaker alerts to your mobile phone.

## 📈 The 4 Core Trading Strategies

| Strategy | Timeframe | Indicators | Description | Stop / Profit Bounds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Trend Following** | `15m` / `1h` | EMA 9/21 cross, MACD hist, ADX > 25 | Enters in direction of dominant trend on 15m and 1h. Disabled automatically in `RANGING` markets. | `1.5x ATR` SL / `3.0x ATR` TP |
| **2. Mean Reversion** | `1m` / `15m` | RSI Divergence, BB (20,2), VWAP, StochRSI | Identifies pivot points on overextended prices near Bollinger Bands. Disabled automatically in `HIGH_VOLATILITY` regimes. | `1.0x ATR` SL / `1.5x ATR` TP |
| **3. Volume Breakout** | `15m` | Vol > 2x avg, OBV trend, ATR spike | Catches momentum breakouts early when price breaks 20-period highs/lows with significant volume confirmation. | `1.5x ATR` SL / `4.0x ATR` TP |
| **4. Funding Rate Fade** | Live API | Funding rate extremes, Open Interest change | Contrarian fade strategy. Goes LONG if funding <-0.15% and SHORT if funding >0.15% with rising open interest confirmation. | `1.5x ATR` SL / `3.0x ATR` TP |

## 🏆 Sourcing & Sizing Advantages (Why it's Better)

*   **$0 Data Costs**: Standard bots require subscription fees for premium feeds ($50–$300/month for on-chain data, options flow, or sentiment indexes). By using Binance's public REST and Websocket APIs, this system runs with **zero operating cost**, allowing 100% of profit to compound.
*   **Derivatives Alpha**: Unlike retail bots that look only at indicators like RSI, this bot queries derivatives indicators (**Funding Rates** and **Open Interest**) to enter high-probability trades when retail traders are over-leveraged and trapped.
*   **Volatile Asset Arbitrage**: Multi-symbol iteration scans across active contracts. If one coin is consolidating (no signal), it immediately moves on to scan and enter setups on others (e.g. `SOLUSDT` or `XRPUSDT`).
